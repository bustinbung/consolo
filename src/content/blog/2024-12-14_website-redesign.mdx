## Starting Out

I knew my website was due for a redesign. The old version of the site was using a design held over from the days when I wanted to be a computer science major, and the look reflects that. It was never really built to showcase media, and it looked **really** bad on mobile devices as it was built for desktop first.

import old_site_home from '@assets/img/blog/redesign/old-site-home.png';

import old_site_home_mobile from '@assets/img/blog/redesign/old-site-home-mobile.png';

<Figure

    alt="A screenshot of the old site on mobile"
    caption="The old site on mobile. Look at that footer!" />

## Drawing Inspiration

I've always been a fan of minimal, geometric designs.

[Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering/)'s designs have always been some of my favorites. Their designs always look and feel playful and elegant while still being functional.

I love the aesthetic of the [Anytype](https://anytype.io) website.[^1] The clean, thin grids, the Macintosh System 1 inspired icons and graphics, and the little splashes of color all blend together well.

import anytype_home from '@assets/img/blog/redesign/anytype-home.png';

<Figure

    caption="Anytype's homepage" />

As it turns out, this style of design has a name: Swiss Style.

### Swiss Style

"[Swiss Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Style_(design))" is a graphic design trend that centers (broadly) around grids, sans-serif fonts, and asymmetrical designs. [^2]

Josef Müller-Brockmann was an influential Swiss style designer, helping spread Swiss style beyond Europe.[^3]

You might be familiar with American designer Paul Rand, known for his work on iconic logos like ABC and IBM. He was one of the first American designers to embrace Swiss style in his work.[^4][^5]

## Designing

I did all of my designing work in [Figma](https://figma.com), with some help from [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io), a free alternative to Figma's Dev Mode.

To avoid the pitfalls that came from designing desktop first and then squeezing it down for mobile, I worked on the mobile version first.


[^1]: Anytype is a pretty great free and open-source Notion alternative with a focus on privacy and decentralized sync. It's got a super deep typing and relations system that's a bit hard to wrap your head around the first time, but it's a really incredible piece of software.
