## Starting Out

I knew my website was due for a redesign. The old version of the site was using a design held over from the days when I wanted to be a computer science major, and the look reflects that. It was never really built to showcase media, and it looked **really** bad on mobile devices as it was built for desktop first.

import old_site_home from '@assets/img/blog/redesign/old-site-home.png';

<Figure

    alt="A screenshot of the old site"
    caption="The old site's homepage" />

import old_site_home_mobile from '@assets/img/blog/redesign/old-site-home-mobile.png';

<Figure
    src={old_site_home_mobile}
    alt="A screenshot of the old site on mobile"
    caption="The old site on mobile. Look at that footer!" />

## Drawing Inspiration

I've always been a fan of minimal, geometric designs.

[Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering/)'s designs have always been some of my favorites. Their designs always look and feel playful and elegant while still being functional.

import op_1 from '@assets/img/blog/redesign/op-1.png';

<Figure
    src={op_1}
    alt="Teenage Engineering's OP-1 synthesizer" />

I love the aesthetic of the [Anytype](https://anytype.io) website.[^1] The clean, thin grids, the Macintosh System 1 inspired icons and graphics, and the little splashes of color all blend together well.

import anytype_home from '@assets/img/blog/redesign/anytype-home.png';

<Figure
    src={anytype_home}
    alt="A screenshot of the Anytype homepage"
    caption="Anytype's homepage" />

As it turns out, this style of design has a name: Swiss Style.

### Swiss Style

"[Swiss Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Style_(design))" is a graphic design trend that centers (broadly) around grids, sans-serif fonts, and asymmetrical designs.[^2]

Josef Müller-Brockmann was an influential Swiss style designer, helping spread Swiss style beyond Europe.[^3]

    alt="Some samples of Josef Müller-Brockmann's work"/>

You might be familiar with American designer Paul Rand, known for his work on iconic logos like ABC and IBM. He was one of the first American designers to embrace Swiss style in his work.[^4][^5]

## Designing

I did all of my designing work in [Figma](https://figma.com).

To avoid the pitfalls that came from designing desktop first and then squeezing it down for mobile, I worked on the mobile version first.

I made extensive use of Figma's auto layout to simulate CSS flexboxes, and designing this way helped me avoid some design decisions that would have been...painful to actually implement.

import painful_mobile from '../../assets/img/blog/redesign/painful-mobile.jpg';

<Figure 
    src={painful_mobile}
    alt="A screenshot of the first iteration of the design. The header text is centered on the border."
    caption="Not sure how I'd recreate this header design" />

Nevertheless, work was steady, and I'm pleased with the result.

import design_versions from '../../assets/img/blog/redesign/design-versions.webp';

<Figure 
    src={design_versions}
    alt="An animated image showing the progress of the design over time."
    caption="Design over time" />

All in all, the total design process (according to Figma version history tracking) took 20 days.

## Development

Developing the website, in all, took about a month. I worked in [Astro](https://astro.build), a JavaScript framework and static site generator (SSG). I could have used another SSG like [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), but Astro is popular and I heard good things about the developer experience.

For those who don't understand how Astro works, sites are built using [components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/): reusable UI elements that are encapsulated in a single file. You might have a group of buttons for example:

```html
<div>
    <button>Button 1</button>
    <button>Button 2</button>
    <button>Button 3</button>
    <button>Button 4</button>
</div>
```

This is fine, but what if you want to reuse this button group somewhere else? Instead of copying and pasting the code (and having to update every instance if you change something), you could create a component and reuse the component throughout your UI.

```astro
<!-- ButtonGroup.astro -->
<div>
    <button>Button 1</button>
    <button>Button 2</button>
    <button>Button 3</button>
    <button>Button 4</button>
</div>
```

```astro
<!-- index.astro -->
<ButtonGroup />
<ButtonGroup />
```

My site is built on the
