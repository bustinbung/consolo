## Starting Out

I knew my website was due for a redesign. The old version of the site was using a design held over from the days when I wanted to be a computer science major, and the look reflects that. It was never really built to showcase media, and it looked **really** bad on mobile devices as it was built for desktop first.

import old_site_home from '@assets/img/blog/redesign/old-site-home.png';

<Figure

    caption="The old site's homepage" />

import old_site_home_mobile from '@assets/img/blog/redesign/old-site-home-mobile.png';

### Inspiration

I've always been a fan of minimal, geometric designs.

[Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering/)'s designs have always been some of my favorites.

import op_1 from '@assets/img/blog/redesign/op-1.png';

I love the aesthetic of the [Anytype](https://anytype.io) website.[^1]

import anytype_home from '@assets/img/blog/redesign/anytype-home.png';

<Figure

    caption="Anytype's homepage" />


[^1]: Anytype is a pretty great free and open-source Notion replacement with a focus on privacy and decentralized sync. Definitely not close to feature parity with Notion, but Notion also tries to do too much so maybe a win?
