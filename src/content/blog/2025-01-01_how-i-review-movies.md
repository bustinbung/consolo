## The Problem

I haven't watched many movies.

Well, I haven't watched many "classic" movies. Chances are, if it's a film from the last 200 years that wasn't released for kids in the 2000s or 2010s, I probably haven't seen it. As an aspiring media professional, that's a bit embarassing. So! In order to expand my movie palate, I've made the goal of watching a new movie every week this year (we'll see how long this holds up).

I wanted to use [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) to track what I've watched, when I watched it, and what I thought of it. The first two are easy, but the last one scares me a bit. Because of my limited experience watching movies, I don't really know how to rate things. Letterboxd gives you a scale out of 5.

## The System

Because of Letterboxd's 5 star rating system, 1 point is the equivalent of 0.5 stars (i.e., a 5 is 2.5 stars).

| Score | Meaning |
| -----: | -------|
| 0 | I would pay money for this to not exist. |
| 1 | You should be paid money to watch this. |
| 2 | I will complain about this in detail. |
| 3 | I will tell you not to watch this. |
| 4 | You don't have a reason to see this. |
| 5 | I would not be upset if you watched this. |
| 6 | It's worth the time, but I'm not recommending it. |
| 7 | If you're asking, I'll recommend it. |
| 8 | I will go out of my way to recommend this. |
| 9 | I think everyone should watch this. |
| 10 | This will change your life. |
