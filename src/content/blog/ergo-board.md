After a long and grueling journey, I've finally settled on a keyboard (I hope) I'll be happy with for the future: the Piantor Pro from [Beekeeb](https://shop.beekeeb.com). It's a very nice low-profile, columnar, split, ergonomical mechanical keyboard with just 42 keys. For the probably 90% of you I just lost, stick with me, and it'll all make sense.

## why bother?
I'm sure the first question on your mind is "Why bother? My keyboard works fine as it is, and I don't see a need to change it." While this might be true, you're missing out on a whole world of comfort, customization, and efficiency that comes with a custom keyboard.

First, comfort. Traditional "row-stagger" keyboards are absolutely awful in almost every possible ergonomic metric. Take a look at the typical layout of a traditional keyboard.

You'll notice that every row is offset from the others. From the number row, the first row of letters (QWE and so on) is offest by 1/2 key. The second row, an additional 1/4 key. And the final row, an additional 1/2 key. This stagger is a holdover from typewriters, as the mechanical linkages between keys and levers prevented keys from being arranged in orderly columns.[^1] Even though modern technology allows us to place keys in practically whatever placement we'd like, people are used to the staggered layout and so it stays.[^2]

By contrast, "columnar" keyboards have their keys laid out in nice, orderly columns.
